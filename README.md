# trading-simulator

## Basic components

+ data
+ portfolio
+ weights estimator


## Overview

This project aims to generate profits by trading five different stocks throughout the year, beginning with an initial capital of $1000. It employs a dynamic programming algorithm to identify the optimal trades for each day, and the relevant data is extracted from CSV files and stored in suitable objects.


## Motivation

I have extensively studied C++ through various books and completed fundamental courses to solidify my understanding of the language. While I have successfully implemented numerous small-scale C++ programs, I recognize the importance of gaining experience in developing larger, more complex projects. To bridge this gap, I actively sought out interesting projects on platforms like GitHub to further enhance my skills.

Given my passion for the fintech industry and its potential to make a tangible impact on the economy and society, I decided to focus on a trading simulator project. This choice allows me to apply the knowledge and techniques I acquired during my university studies to a practical scenario. By immersing myself in this project, I aim to sharpen my C++ skills and gain valuable insights into the fintech industry.

I firmly believe that engaging with real-world projects, such as the trading simulator, not only strengthens my technical capabilities but also provides me with a solid foundation to pursue a career in the dynamic field of fintech.
